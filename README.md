# Temperature Conversion Program

This is a Python program that converts temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin scales. 
The program prompts the user to input a temperature value and the original unit of measurement. 
It then converts the temperature to the other two units and displays the converted values to the user.

## How to Use

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Download or clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the program is located.
4. Run the program by executing the following command:
    
    python Temperature_conversion_Program.py

5. Follow the on-screen instructions to input the temperature value and the unit of measurement (Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin).
6. The program will then display the converted temperature values in the other two units.

## Example

If the user enters a temperature of 25 degrees Celsius, the program will convert it to Fahrenheit and Kelvin, and present the converted values as outputs( 89.60 degrees Fahrenheit and 305.15 Kelvin.).

## Note

- Ensure that you enter the temperature value as a numeric value (e.g., 25) and the unit of measurement exactly as specified (e.g., Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin).
- The program does not handle invalid inputs gracefully. Ensure that you enter valid inputs as per the instructions provided by the program.
